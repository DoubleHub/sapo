# Sapo
Sapo provides seamless conversion from SOAP WSDL to TS interfaces,
leveraging the power of Go text templates.

Example usage will be:
```
sapo example.wsdl.xml
```

Sapo will create a folder called ```generated/``` where you can find
the generated TS interfaces and WebService classes with calls ready
to be made!
